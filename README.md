This [tutorial](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/index.html) illustrate how one can perform gene-based analysis with simple examples. 

### Contents
 - [Mapping Snp to Gene](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/mappingSnpToGene2.html)
   - Assume you have rs-ids, and you want to map rs-ids to gene for gene based analysis. This page illustrate one way to do this.
 - [Getting correlation estimate among SNPs from reference panel](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/CorrFromRef.html)
   - This page illustrate how one can get correlation estimate among SNPs from the reference panel.
 - [R and Perl codes to perform aSPUs and MTaSPUsSet](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/ForMTgenes.html)
   - Assume we have multi-trait summary statistics data for mapped SNPs from [Mapping Snp to Gene](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/mappingSnpToGene2.html), this page illustrate how to perform aSPUs or MTaSPUsSet test using Summary Statistics data.
 - [Vignette for aSPUs and aSPUsPath](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/aSPUstat.html)
   - Adaptive Gene- and Pathway- Trait Association testing with GWAS Summary Statistics (aSPUs() and aSPUsPath())
 - [Vignette for MTaSPUsSet](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ikwak/tutorials/MTaSPUsSet.html)
