Some tutorials for aSPU
=======================

This [tutorial](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/index.html) illustrate how one can perform gene-based analysis with simple examples. 

### Contents
 - [Mapping Snp to Gene](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/mappingSnpToGene2.html)
   - Assume you have rs-ids, and you want to map rs-ids to gene for gene based analysis. This page illustrate one way to do this.
 - [Getting correlation estimate among SNPs from reference panel](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/CorrFromRef.html)
   - This page illustrate how one can get correlation estimate among SNPs from the reference panel.
 - [R and Perl codes to perform aSPUs and MTaSPUsSet](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/ForMTgenes.html)
   - Assume we have multi-trait summary statistics data for mapped SNPs from [Mapping Snp to Gene](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/mappingSnpToGene2.html), this page illustrate how to perform aSPUs or MTaSPUsSet test using Summary Statistics data.
 - [Speed comparison using R, awk and Perl](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/SpeedComp.html)
   - I used `awk` in some tutorials. I do some speed comparison here.
 - [Pathway data manipulation](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/pathwayMani.html)
   - Where to get pathways(or gene sets) and how to manipulate.
 - [Vignette for aSPUs and aSPUsPath](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/aSPUstat.html)
   - Adaptive Gene- and Pathway- Trait Association testing with GWAS Summary Statistics (aSPUs() and aSPUsPath())
 - [Vignette for MTaSPUsSet](https://ikwak2.github.io/tutorials/MTaSPUsSet.html)
   - Adaptive Gene - Multitrait Association testing with GWAS Summary Statistics (MTaSPUsSet() ) 

Part of the data here downloaded from [GIANT consortium data files](https://www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files) website. Data is originally from [Randall JC, Winkler TW, Kutalik Z, Berndt SI, Jackson AU, Monda KL, Kilpeläinen TO, Esko T, Mägi R, Li S, et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754948?dopt=Citation) (2013). Sex-stratified genome-wide association studies including 270,000 individuals show sexual dimorphism in genetic loci for anthropometric traits. PLoS Genet 9: e1003500.
